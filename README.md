# 🧮 FreedomNumber — Financial Freedom Calculator (India)

> _The 4% rule was made for 1990s America. FreedomNumber is built for today’s India — a beautiful, interactive calculator that helps you find your real financial freedom number._

## 🌏 Why this project?

Most personal finance tools still use the **“4% Rule”**, a concept born in the U.S. in the 1990s.  
It said:  
> “If you withdraw 4% of your retirement corpus every year (adjusted for inflation), your money should last 30 years.”

That rule was created by **William P. Bengen (1994)** —  
but it assumed:
- 3% U.S. inflation  
- 50/50 stock-bond portfolio  
- 30-year retirement  
- No taxes or fees  

Those assumptions simply **don’t fit India**.

Our inflation runs hotter (~6–7%), our investment mix is different, and many plan to retire early — meaning a 35–45 year horizon.  
The old 25× thumb rule (annual expenses × 25) is convenient but **not accurate** for Indian realities.

## 🚀 What FreedomNumber does differently

FreedomNumber replaces guesswork with a **data-driven, year-by-year model**.  
It lets you:

✅ Add **regular expenses** with custom growth rates and tenures  
✅ Add **one-time goals** like education, weddings, or medical events  
✅ Apply your **expected returns, inflation, and safety buffer**  
✅ Automatically **goal-seek** the required corpus that lasts till your life expectancy  
✅ View a **live chart** and an interactive **projection table**  

It’s simple, beautiful, and fully in-browser — no Excel, no formulas, no login.

## 📈 Example

If your current annual spending is ₹6 lakh  
and you want to be financially free by 45:  
- 25× rule says ₹1.5 crore is enough  
- FreedomNumber shows you might need closer to **₹2.7–3.0 crore**,  
  factoring India’s inflation, life expectancy, and volatility.
